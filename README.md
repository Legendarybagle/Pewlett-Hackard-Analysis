* The senior engineer and senior staff positions contain the most people close to retiring which makes sense given older people are in higher positions more
* the number of non-senior engineer and staff retiring is not nearly as high

* while there are a lot of people retiring, may of them are eligible to become mentors to teach the remainging staff
* the number of eligible mentors is vastly greater than the amount leaving in the "silver tsunami

## Summary

* according to the data approximatley 72,500 jobs will need to be replaced as the "silver tsunami" hits
* there are 499,495 employees that are eligible to become mentors which is more than enought to train a new generation to take over
